Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Foundations course - The Odin Project

Simple rock paper scissors game against computer.

With this project I tested my JavaScript foundations.

I tried to make the game as convenient as possible with my knowledge.

The goal was to receive the users input based on their choice from UI.

Then compare the users choice with computers and determine a winner of the round.

At the end, player that wins 5 rounds is a winner of the game.

I accomplished this with use of variables and conditions, which were required for this project.

I tried to make the code self explanatory as much as possible atm, so I made it as combination of smaller parts (functionalities).

To achieve this I used function declarations.

Here I learned how to create logic, resolve problems and to approach the project by dividing it to smaller parts.
